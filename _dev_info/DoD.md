# Definition of Done

## Before something can be marked as finished (move post-it), the following requirements must be met:

- All features are documented.
- All debug code is removed.  
- All placeholders are removed.
- All tests pass.  
- Everyone present in the group have reviewed the code, made sure they understand it, and ensured that it follows our coding standards.
